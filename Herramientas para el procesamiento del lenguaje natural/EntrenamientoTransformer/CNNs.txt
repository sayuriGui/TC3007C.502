Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently proven their excellent ability to segment 2D cardiac ultrasound images. However, the majority of attempts to perform full-sequence segmentation of cardiac ultrasound videos either rely on models trained only on keyframe images or fail to maintain the topology over time. To address these issues, in this work, we consider segmentation of ultrasound video as a registration estimation problem and present a novel method for diffeomorphic image registration using neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODE). In particular, we consider the registration field vector field between frames as a continuous trajectory ODE. The estimated registration field is then applied to the segmentation mask of the first frame to obtain a segment for the whole cardiac cycle. The proposed method, Echo-ODE, introduces several key improvements compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Firstly, by solving a continuous ODE, the proposed method achieves smoother segmentation, preserving the topology of segmentation maps over the whole sequence (Hausdorff distance: 3.7-4.4). Secondly, it maintains temporal consistency between frames without explicitly optimizing for temporal consistency attributes, achieving temporal consistency in 91% of the videos in the dataset. Lastly, the proposed method is able to maintain the clinical accuracy of the segmentation maps (MAE of the LVEF: 2.7-3.1).
