One of the key benefits of medical image segmentation is that it allows for a more precise analysis of anatomical data by isolating only necessary areas. For certain procedures, such as implant design, it is necessary to segment out certain structures, for example in the hip or knee. In addition, segmentation offers the benefit of removing any unwanted details from a scan, such as air, as well as allowing different tissues such as bone and soft tissues to be isolated. When combined with different software processing options, researchers and clinicians can generate a series of segmented masks that are ready for further analysis.
