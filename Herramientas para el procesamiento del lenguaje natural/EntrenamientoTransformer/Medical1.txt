Medical image segmentation involves the extraction of regions of interest (ROIs) from 3D image data, such as from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) scans. The main goal of segmenting this data is to identify areas of the anatomy required for a particular study, for example, to simulate physical properties or virtually positioning CAD-designed implants within a patient. Medical image segmentation can be a time-consuming task, and recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) software techniques are making it easier for routine tasks to be completed.
