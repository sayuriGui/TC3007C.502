Echocardiography, the non-invasive imaging inspection tool, is widely applied in the clinical routine of CVDs. The analysis of echocardiography is often used clinically for appraising cardiac morphology and function. For example, the ejection fraction (EF) of the left ventricle (LV) is one of the famous clinical indices to quantify the LV systolic function. The LVEF can be calculated by the volume of the left ventricle. The width of the left ventricular myocardium also contains pathological information. The exact segmentation of the left ventricle endocardium (LVendo) and the left ventricle epicardium (LVepi) provides the clinical quantitative measures mentioned above. However, manual echocardiography labeling requires a doctor with rich clinical expertise to spend a lot of time, which seriously affects diagnostic efficiency. Smart health [3,4] can assist clinical diagnosis, such as automatic echocardiography segmentation. Automatic echocardiography segmentation remains an unresolved challenge due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and low contrast. The boundaries between anatomical structures are ambiguous and sometimes missing in echocardiography, and the performance of traditional segmentation methods is not satisfactory.
