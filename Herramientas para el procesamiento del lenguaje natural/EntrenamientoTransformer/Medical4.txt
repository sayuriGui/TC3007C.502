Medical image segmentation faces several challenges, including:

    Image variability: Diverse image characteristics make creating a universal segmentation algorithm challenging.
    Ambiguity and complexity: Complex structures, ambiguous boundaries, and overlapping regions complicate accurate segmentation.
    Limited labeled data: The scarcity of annotated medical images hampers developing and evaluating segmentation algorithms.
    Computational complexity: Large datasets and high-dimensional images require substantial computational resources and time.
    Validation and generalization: Ensuring accuracy and applicability across different modalities, populations, and clinical settings is difficult yet crucial.
